The intention of the mod is to make the world of Rimworld more varied and interesting, This mod will add multiple new Biomes to the world along with the plants and animals to populate them. A few Biomes have been planned out so far but suggestions are always welcome.

This mod requires Jecstools to work!

This will be the initial release of the mod and will only include the Cavern biome. We will progressively tweak and add more to the biome until we deem it finished.
